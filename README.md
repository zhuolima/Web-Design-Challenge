# Web-Visualization-Dashboard


## Background
Create a Visualization Dashboard Website of Weather in 500+ World Cities Relative to the Equator at Different Latitudes Using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 4

### Objectives
In building this dashboard, create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

### Website Requirements
The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

A Landing Page containing:
An explanation of the project
Links to each visualizations page
